            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Language of our <hi>Blushes</hi> has sufficiently spoke our Passion; and you might (had you not been <hi>Insensible</hi>) have read our desires plainly Legible in

How have we made it our Business to spruce up and finifie our selves that we might appear to the best Advantage? Witness our perpetual <hi>Washings, Combings, Curlings, Powderings</hi> and a thousand Chargeable Devices of the <hi>Tailer,</hi> and the <hi>Tire-woman,</hi> our studied Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, various <hi>Dresses,</hi> affected Postures, tempting <hi>Smiles,</hi> and <hi>Amorous Glances</hi> whereby we even darted our very <hi>Souls</hi> at you, were all but so many modest <hi>Invitations</hi> for you to <hi>fall on;</hi> yet (<hi>Cowards</hi> that you are) you seem still to <hi>decline</hi> the Encounter, and view us with no more <hi>Passion,</hi> than if we were only Ivory <hi>Statues,</hi> or so many handsome <hi>Pictures.</hi> Can you think we were at all this trouble for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or imagine that we would ever have <hi>Trimm'd</hi> up these <hi>Tenements</hi> of our Bodies so Curiously, but with an intent to <hi>Lett them?</hi> must you not confess your selves <hi>Inhumane,</hi> and more Uncharitable than Beasts and Savages to suffer so many plump <hi>Virgins</hi> to Languish and Pine away with the <hi>Green-Sickness,</hi> when it lies solely in your Power to Relieve them?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may Alledge in your own Desence, That you have been ready on alll Occasions to offer your <hi>Assistance,</hi> but Alas! it was by <hi>such</hi> a Method of Cure as was worse than the Disease; Palliating the <hi>White Feaver</hi> with the more grievous Plague of a <hi>Timpany.</hi>

<q>
                  <l>— Or Marry or else forsake us,</l>

            </p>
            <p>But the plain truth is, to our unspeakable grief we find you such <hi>Heathen</hi> Libertines, that the Divine and most <hi>comfortable</hi> Institution of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> is grown odious, or at least contemptible to most of you: As if the <hi>Common</hi> afforded sweeter Pasture than the <hi>Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> or durty Puddle-water that every one lies <hi>dabling</hi> in, were to be preferred before a private Spring: A <hi>Miss,</hi> a <hi>Miss,</hi> is the only thing; and there is scarce a <hi>Prentice</hi> of sixteen, but puts the <hi>Chouse</hi> upon his Master
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96144:4"/>to help maintain some small piece of <hi>Harlotry</hi> abroad: you count <hi>Fornication</hi> but a <hi>Venial Trifle,</hi> and yet think honest Marriage an unpardonable sin. A Whore is become a necessary <hi>Appurtenance,</hi> and to keep her <hi>nobly</hi> part of the Character of a <hi>Gentleman;</hi> whilst to love a Mans own <hi>Wise</hi> is voted worfe than <hi>Cuckoldry,</hi> and an Infallible mark of a Sot and a Fop. <hi>Brisk</hi> and <hi>Aiery</hi> is the Word (in plain <hi>English, Rompish</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent</hi>) and to be honest, or modest, you count <hi>Ill-breeding</hi> in a Woman. There is scarce any of you that Court <hi>Beauty</hi> seriously, and <hi>Vertue</hi> none at all: your pretences of making <hi>Love</hi> to us, are only, either baits to <hi>debauch</hi> us, or designs to get our <hi>Money:</hi> If ever you venture to Marry us, we do but <hi>purchase</hi> contempt and slavery for term of Life; and <hi>sell</hi> our selves at the Price of our Portions: Not to say of our <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> too, though 'tis most seriously true, that your Bodies are generaly as <hi>filthy</hi> as your Souls, and fuller of Diseases than an <hi>Hospitall.</hi> We will not tell you of your <hi>dissimulations</hi> and perfideousness, nor yet of your flatteries and breach of <hi>Vows,</hi> since you glory in all these, as your choicest accomplishments; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so impertinent as to be angry with you: for sure in your present <hi>Reprobate-state</hi> you are worthy none of you passions but Horn. Hence forwards therefore, when you <hi>whine</hi> and <hi>fawn</hi> on us, we will only be so kind as to <hi>Laugh</hi> at you. 'Twill be rare diversion to see you like <hi>Monkies</hi> acting your passionate Amours with a thousand <hi>ridiculous</hi> Grimaces; repeating shreds of <hi>Plays</hi> instead of Natural wit, which you are strangers to: and <hi>hiring</hi> Poets to write most passionate Letters of <hi>dull nonsense</hi> to us. To observe what little silly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96144:4"/>tricks you use to <hi>Charm</hi> us with variety of <hi>gay Cloths,</hi> till you have either made the <hi>Confiding Taylor</hi> a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, or he has got you in <hi>Limbo</hi> for your entrusted bravery; and then at last having wasted both your <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Bodies:</hi> How you either are trappan'd into the dreadful Marriagc <hi>Noose</hi> by a Common Strumpet, under prettence of a <hi>Fortune,</hi> or doat in good earnest on some <hi>greasie Kitchin-wench,</hi> or at best are glad meerly for a wretched Lively hood, to Wed some ugly deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most <hi>abominable</hi> old Widdow of fourscore, who frights you out of your little wits in the day-time by her Meager <hi>looks;</hi> and in the Night with her everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cough</hi> and nasty Rheumes.</p>
            <p>One of these <hi>Chances</hi> is certainly your Fate; and therefore he advised in time: leave off these silly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant <hi>Rambles</hi> attended with nothing but <hi>shame</hi> and Infamy, and List your selves amongst honest drudging good <hi>Common wealths-men,</hi> who take care both for the <hi>necessities</hi> of the time present, and the <hi>Interests</hi> of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so as to People the World in the next Age with the <hi>Labours</hi> of a lawful Bed, and not a <hi>spurious</hi> Issue: Then shall you find that the embraces of a <hi>modest</hi> Wise are not only more <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>wholesome,</hi> but much more <hi>pleasant</hi> than the treacherous Dalliances of a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Miss,</hi> though never so <hi>sprightly</hi> or well skill'd in all the modes of <hi>Petulancy:</hi> and that the Feaverish heats of never-satisfied <hi>Lust</hi> are no more to be compared to the comfortable and constant warmth of a well-grounded <hi>Love,</hi> than <hi>Bristoll</hi> stones are to real <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this hope, that you will lay these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to heart, and for the future behave your selves
